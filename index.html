Hi, my name is Caspian Farman-Farmaian, and currently I am a sophomore at the Browning School in Manhattan. While I love the energy and fast-paced environment of New York City, I have learned that I'm happiest close to the ocean. To me, the ocean is calm and beautiful, and I'm captivated by its scale and how full of life it is. I'm especially passionate about environmental protection and spending time outdoors. I think it's really important to stay connected with nature and to continue protecting it. This past summer I embarked on a two-week backpacking journey through the forests of Wyoming, hiking and camping throughout the trip.
